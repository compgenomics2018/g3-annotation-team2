The package contains these files:

README           - This file
LipoP            - Perl script for running the predictor
LipoPformat      - Perl script for formatting the output
lipop_decode     - binary hmm program used by the script
LipoP1.0.mod     - model file used by decodeanhmm
LipoP1.0a.html   - LipoP user's guide

For plotting gnuplot is needed (making postscript plots).

When generating html output the postscript plots are converted to
gif, and for this you need the programs ghostscript (gs) and ppmto...

=====================================
Installation:

Place decodeanhmm and LipoP1.0.mod where you
would like them to reside (e.g. in the LipoP1.0a directory).

Check that the perl path is correct in LipoP and LipoPformat
(first line in the scripts, e.g. "#!/usr/bin/perl").
Put LipoP in your path.

Make sure that paths for decodeanhmm and LipoPformat are
set correctly in LipoP. Also make sure that $libdir is the
correct path for LipoP1.0.mod.

Make sure that paths for gnuplot, gs, and perhaps a ppmto...
are set correctly in LipoPformat.
